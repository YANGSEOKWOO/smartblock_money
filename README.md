SmartThings
-------------

**SmartThings** is a one of IOT platform. This provide an automated service to a user using SmartApp and SmartDevice.

**SmartApp** is a Groovy-based program that allows developers to create automation for users to tap into the capabilities of SmartDevice.


Smart Block

Why do users need Smart Block?
-------------
Users can have difficulty in writing SmartApp in Groovy code textually.

Smart Block which is a visual block language can help users develop SmartApp easily by building blocks graphically.

When users build the blocks in smart block, it offers the actual groovy code to user

So, Users can develop SmartApp easily in Smart Block, even though they are not expert programmers.
